# Analysis and Recommendations for Performance Improvements in Isoline

## Abstract

This paper examines potential bottlenecks in the current implementation of the Isoline engine, which exhibits a low framerate (approximately 4 FPS). We review key components in the game’s structure, particularly around rendering and update scheduling, and propose targeted changes geared toward leveraging efficient GPU usage and reducing CPU overhead.

## 1. Introduction

The Isoline engine is a Python-based isometric vector graphics engine using Pyglet. Although the game logic and update mechanisms run at a target of 60 updates per second, the visible output remains around 4 FPS. This whitepaper identifies performance bottlenecks and recommends strategies for optimizing both rendering and update handling.

## 2. Analysis of Current Implementation

### a. Main Loop and Update Scheduling
- The engine schedules updates at 1/60.0 seconds, which is appropriate. However, if the rendering pipeline is blocking or CPU-bound, updates and draws can stall.
- The low FPS measured by the Pyglet FPS display indicates performance issues in either CPU or GPU usage.

### b. Rendering Pipeline (tile_renderer.py and main.py)
- The engine uses vector graphics (via `pyglet.shapes.Line`) to render individual tiles and grass blades.
- In `VectorTile.draw`, each tile’s outline and content shapes are drawn using individual draw() calls.
- Multiple draw calls per tile increase OpenGL context switches and overhead when rendering many tiles.

## 3. Identified Bottlenecks

- **High Draw Call Count:** Instantiating and drawing shapes individually increases overhead from numerous OpenGL context switches.
- **Dynamic Object Creation:** Repeated creation and position adjustment of shape objects contributes to CPU overhead.
- **Lack of Batching:** Without batching similar primitives, the GPU misses opportunities for optimized draw calls.

## 4. Recommendations for Performance Improvements

### a. Implement Batch Rendering
- Utilize Pyglet’s `Batch` object to group render instructions, reducing the number of individual draw calls.
- Static tiles can be pre-batched and updated only when necessary.

### b. Use Vertex Arrays/Lists
- Precompute and store vertex arrays instead of creating individual shape objects for each element.
- Update buffers in bulk to reduce per-frame overhead.

### c. Cache Static Elements
- Identify and cache static elements to avoid re-computing geometry each frame.

### d. Optimize Update Logic
- Streamline translation and transformation calculations to minimize CPU overhead.
- Only update elements that change, rather than recalculating every frame.

### e. Profiling and Iterative Testing
- Use profiling tools to pinpoint additional bottlenecks.
- Evaluate performance differences between immediate mode rendering and batched approaches.

## 5. Architectural Considerations (Using uv)

- Given the use of uv (an event loop or framework), ensure asynchronous operations offload non-rendering tasks from the main thread.
- Maintain a properly activated .venv to ensure that dependencies optimized for performance are used.

## 6. Conclusion

The primary issues in the Isoline engine are related to high-per-instance draw operations and lack of batching. By implementing batch rendering, vertex arrays, and caching static geometry, performance can be significantly improved. Further iterative profiling should be employed to continue optimizing the engine.
