Here's a breakdown of the current approach and recommendations for performance enhancement:

Current State:

Batching: You're correctly using pyglet.graphics.Batch for drawing, which is good.
Updates: The renderer distinguishes between full rebuilds (large camera moves) and incremental updates (_update_dirty_tiles) for small moves and animations.
Vertex Data Caching: VectorTile caches the raw vertex positions and colors for each animation state in _vertex_data_cache. This avoids recalculating geometry like grass sway for every frame or instance.
Shape Creation Bottleneck: The main performance issue lies in how this cached data is used. The add_vertex_lists_to_batch method (called by add_to_batch) iterates through the cached vertex data and creates new pyglet.shapes.Line objects every time a tile is added or updated in the batch. Creating and destroying potentially thousands of these small shape objects frequently (especially during camera movement or animation) is computationally expensive.
Recommendations:

Utilize True Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs):
Problem: Repeatedly creating pyglet.shapes.Line objects negates the benefits of caching vertex data.
Solution: Modify VectorTile to create and manage pyglet.graphics.vertexdomain.VertexList objects directly using the cached vertex data.
Create vertex lists once per tile state (or perhaps once per tile type if geometry is identical).
Store these VertexList objects within the VectorTile instance.
In add_to_batch, instead of creating shapes, add the pre-existing VertexList to the batch and set its translation property to (x, y). Updating transforms is much cheaper than object creation/destruction.
Animation updates (update_animation) could potentially modify the vertex data within the existing VertexList objects (e.g., vertex_list.vertices = new_data) for the tiles that changed state, rather than triggering a full shape recreation via _update_dirty_tiles.
Optimize _update_dirty_tiles:
Problem: This method currently involves deleting old shapes and creating new ones for tiles that moved slightly or changed animation state.
Solution (with VBOs): This method would become much simpler. It would primarily involve updating the translation property of the existing VertexList objects associated with the dirty tiles.
Consider Instancing (Advanced): If you have many identical tiles (e.g., large areas of grass), GPU instancing (as mentioned in your docs) could provide further gains. This involves telling the GPU to draw the same base geometry multiple times with different positions/transforms in a single draw call. Pyglet has some support for this, but it adds complexity. Focus on VBOs first.
Profiling: Use Python's cProfile module or py-spy to measure execution time in different functions. This will confirm the bottleneck is shape creation/deletion and quantify the impact of optimizations.
In summary, the most significant performance improvement will likely come from replacing the repeated creation of pyglet.shapes.Line objects with the management and transformation of persistent pyglet.graphics.vertexdomain.VertexList objects (VBOs).
