# Isoline Performance Recommendations

This document outlines recommendations for improving the performance of the Isoline pyglet vector graphics rendering pipeline.

## 1. Reduce Batch Rebuilds

The `needs_rebuild` flag triggers a full batch rebuild, which can be costly. Consider the following:

-   Implement a more granular update system that only updates tiles that have changed, rather than rebuilding the entire batch.
-   Investigate ways to optimize camera movement and map loading to reduce the frequency of batch rebuilds.

## 2. Optimize Vector Shape Generation

The `create_shapes_for_batch` and `_create_content_shapes` methods are responsible for generating vector shapes for each tile. Consider the following:

-   Cache generated shapes to avoid redundant calculations.
-   Use more efficient shape primitives (e.g., triangles instead of lines).
-   Explore alternative rendering techniques, such as using textures, to reduce the number of shapes that need to be drawn.

## 3. Simplify Tile Complexity

Complex tile designs with many vector shapes can impact rendering performance. Consider the following:

-   Experiment with simpler tile designs.
-   Reduce the number of vector shapes used in each tile.

## 4. Explore GPU Instancing

Pyglet and OpenGL support GPU instancing, which allows rendering multiple copies of the same object with different transformations in a single draw call. Consider the following:

-   Implement GPU instancing to render large numbers of identical tiles efficiently.

## 5. Profile and Measure

Use profiling tools to identify the specific bottlenecks in the rendering pipeline. Measure the impact of each optimization to ensure it is actually improving performance.
